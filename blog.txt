This file provides the links to my blog page hosted on GitHub pages, and my GitHub repository, containing the data used for analysis, the jupyter notebook used to analyse the data, and the files used to build the blog post page. I go into details on how these work in the README file.

Blog Link:

NOTE:
The blog does not work well on mobile devices. If you need to view this on a mobile device, I suggest using the file "Analysing the effects of VAR on English Football Blog.pdf", which is the PDF version of the blog, with slightly worse looking graphs.
For the best viewing experience, I suggest viewing the blog on a laptop through  clicking the link.
Also, I added animations to each graph, so reload the page if you missed them!
