            Football is a way of life for many people across the world, and the English Premier League (EPL) is heart and center of it all. With support all over the world, people from entirely different backgrounds all come together to pledge their undying allegiance to a team of eleven players. But to the supporters, it is so much more than just eleven players. 
            According to a paper titled “The Hooligans’ Death List” (Alsiö, n.d.), England has the joint third highest number of incidents relating to football hooliganism. That is falling just behind Brazil and Argentina, who’s passion for football is essentially engraved in their DNA, with a multitude of footballing legends having hailed from those two countries alone. Not only that, but a study found (Kirby et al., 2013)  “the risk of domestic abuse rose by 26 percent when the English national team won or drew, and a 38 percent increase when the national team lost.” 
            These stats are not just stats, they are serious problems. While the players and teams are not responsible for these events, the footballing officials must ensure that each game is officiated with integrity, because so much rides on the shoulders of these football matches. The integrity of the game has—unfortunately, been tainted with the introduction of VAR. With almost daily controversy, inconsistent decision-making, and constant discussion over whether it makes the game better.
            So I set out to find… HOW much has VAR had an effect on the English Premier League?

            Fouls
            VAR stands for “Video Assistant Referee”, and it corrects on-field officiating mistakes. On the surface this seems like a great idea to reduce controversy, but in reality it has multiple negative effects on the game like interrupting the flow of the game, which can be game changing. Not only this, but VAR is usually used when fouls are made in dangerous areas, and has led to a lot of key decisions on whether a goal should be allowed or if a penalty should be awarded. 
            VAR was first introduced in the 2019/2020 season, and has had a lot of rule changes since that date.
            The first question we will answer is; How has VAR affected the amount of fouls committed? To address this question I have used data from each premier league season (England Football Results Betting Odds | Premiership Results & Betting Odds, n.d.). The data starts from the 2000/01 season, so we have access to all of the data since then until the writing of this blog post (April 2024). Please note that the current season is not finished as of writing this blog post, so expect the final year of each statistic to be somewhat larger by the end of the season.
            We can first visualize how fouls have been affected by measuring the amount of fouls committed per season:
