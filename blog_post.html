        <h1>Analyzing the effects of VAR on English Football</h1>

        <section id="blog-post">
            <p>Football is a way of life for many people across the world, and the English Premier League (EPL) 
                is heart and center of it all. With support all over the world, people from entirely different backgrounds 
                all come together to pledge their undying allegiance to a team of eleven players. But to the supporters, it 
                is so much more than just eleven players. </p>
            <p>According to a paper titled “The Hooligans’ Death List” (Alsiö, n.d.), England has the joint third highest 
                number of incidents relating to football hooliganism. That is falling just behind Brazil and Argentina, who’s
                 passion for football is essentially engraved in their DNA, with a multitude of footballing legends having 
                 hailed from those two countries alone. Not only that, but a study found (Kirby et al., 2013)  “the risk of
                  domestic abuse rose by 26 percent when the English national team won or drew, and a 38 percent increase 
                  when the national team lost.” </p>
            <p>These stats are not just stats, they are serious problems. While the players and teams are not 
                responsible for these events, the footballing officials must ensure that each game is officiated with integrity,
                 because so much rides on the shoulders of these football matches. The integrity of the game has—unfortunately, 
                 been tainted with the introduction of VAR. With almost daily controversy, inconsistent decision-making, and constant
                  discussion over whether it makes the game better.</p>
            <p>So I set out to find… HOW much has VAR had an effect on the English Premier League?</p>

            <h2>Fouls</h2>
            <p>VAR stands for “Video Assistant Referee”, and it corrects on-field officiating mistakes. On the surface this seems
                 like a great idea to reduce controversy, but in reality it has multiple negative effects on the game like
                  interrupting the flow of the game, which can be game changing. Not only this, but VAR is usually used when 
                  fouls are made in dangerous areas, and has led to a lot of key decisions on whether a goal should be allowed 
                  or if a penalty should be awarded. </p>
            <p>VAR was first introduced in the 2019/2020 season, and has had a lot of rule changes since that date.</p>
            <p>The first question we will answer is; How has VAR affected the amount of fouls committed? To address this question
                 I have used data from each premier league season (England Football Results Betting Odds | Premiership Results & Betting Odds, n.d.). 
                 The data starts from the 2000/01 season, so we have access to all of the data since then until the writing of this blog post (April 2024). 
                 Please note that the current season is not finished as of writing this blog post, so expect the final year of each statistic to be somewhat larger by the end of the season.</p>
            
            <p>We can first visualize how fouls have been affected by measuring the amount of fouls committed per season:</p>

                </div> 
                                    
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>There seems to be a somewhat downward trend in fouls committed over time, which is consistent with the increase in quality over time, as teams improve their game, and tactics are refined.</p>
                <p>However, the huge spike in the 2020/2021 season seems to be a deviation from the standard volatility. The first question I had after seeing this was; “why did VAR increase fouls so much, but only the year after being implemented?”</p>
                <p>It is hard to say whether VAR was the sole reason for this, but VAR did go through major changes after its first season. Let’s examine… </p>
                <p>In the first season of VAR (2019/2020), we see the lowest amount of fouls ever recorded. This is surprising since we would expect to see fouls increase as VAR would remove the ‘benefit of the doubt’ decisions, however the first season saw a very restrained use of VAR. It only reviewed “clear and obvious errors” (Premier League Rule Changes and VAR in the 2019/20 Season, n.d.), and had many controversial decisions where the VAR officials decided to make lenient decisions, or decide not to intervene. But, teams could have also been more risk averse as they were cautious of VAR calls.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the 2020/2021 season changed the rules to be less subjective (VAR Is Back in the Premier League! How It’s Changed for 2020-21, 2020), and instead provided clear instructions as to what was, and wasn’t, a foul. This was a change to make VAR less polarizing, but it would have also had an effect on the on-field refereeing. Many of football’s subjective fouls became objective, and many more fouls were given, especially in the penalty box. Remember this for later, as there is a similar spike related to goals scored in the 2020/2021 season. </p>
                <h2>Cards</h2>
                <p>VAR can only be used for four scenarios; goals and the incidents leading to them, penalties, red cards, and mistaken identity (Premier League Rule Changes and VAR in the 2019/20 Season, n.d.). Unexpectedly, when looking at red cards awarded per season, it
                    is hard to see a trend at all:</p>
